This was a project for my diplomatic thesis. 
In it I used Django with React to create a Budget tracker app with a multitude of options. 
We have a User who creates an account with his email, gets the confirmation email and verifies their account. 
After that the user logs in, he gets gretted by a simple page where he can add expenses. 
The user can also add income, see the stats oing back six months, he can export them in 3 different formats (-.csv, .xsls, and .pdf). 
Also the user can change their preffered currency, but changing it doesn't automatically convert them, this is just a aestetic feature that can be upgared with a simple API. 
The user can log out and delete their account if they want to. 

There is a lot of room for improvement, but I decided to cut it here and work on updates when I have the time. 
Hope you like it!
